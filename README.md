# Coordinator

**Coordinator** A dead easy way to coordinate multiple instances of Unity. With it, you will be able to boot up multiple Unity Editors in order for them to help iterate with your **multiplayer** game. You can choose to have stand alone editors. Editors that go into playmode. Or lastly, Editors that play until a test is finished. **This project is in active development.** There are a lot of moving parts with this project so even though it works in a few cases it certainly does not work for the majority of cases.

## Features

* **Standalone** interact with your symlinked or hard copy editors manually as if you created them and opened them yourself
* **Playmode** your additional editors will go into playmode when the original main editor goes into playmode. Perfect getting up an into a multplayer game with less steps. 
* **TestAndPlaymode** is the solution to be even less hands on. The editors will go into playmode until the main editor calls ```Editors.TestComplete``` and then call a post test method for you (perfect for going through a set of tests and then uploading a build)
* **Scripting Defines** so you can have on Editor run as **Server** and the other as **Client** (or perhaps **Demo**)

## Installation

- Add this GitHub URL to your package manager or, instead, in your 'manifest.json' add
```json
  "dependencies": {
	...

    	"com.moonlitstudios.coordinator": "https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/com.moonlitstudios.coordinator.git",

	...
  }
```

None of that working? **Honestly, just reach out us!** (Links & methods towards the bottom).


## How does it work?
Additional Editors are created with Symlinks or Hard copies. We use files on disk that allow each editor to communicate with each other (easier then rolling a socket solution or more elobrate interprocess communication). Thats 90% of how it works.
